  Meteor animation 

motivation: Cartoon-like or old-fashion animation fit with the times where people have been constantly consuming digital and more sophisticated images and animation. I love to see more of motion graphics like that.

practice: I was decicated with textures applied to the animation since the feel of paper and wiggle style will be easily messed up by creating unnecessary noise. So I spent some time tweaking what <i>feels</i> right.
